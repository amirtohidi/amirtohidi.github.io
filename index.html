Considered broadly, I am a Computational Social Scientist. 
I study human behavior, how it interacts with information systems, and how it is shaped by different social and economic settings. 
During my Ph.D., I have been working on a range of empirical social and economic problems. 
The interdisciplinary nature of my research is a manifestation of my diverse training and interest in important and intriguing problems.
My research combines economic and behavioral insights with advanced computational methods in causal inference and machine learning to tackle important managerial problems or answer questions of general interest in the social sciences.
To this end, I use various forms of online/field/natural experimental designs for causal identification.
