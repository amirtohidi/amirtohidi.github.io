Considered broadly, I am a Computational Social Scientist. I study human behavior, how it interacts with information systems, and how it is shaped by different social and economic settings. We are living in an increasingly complex world that we have not evolved to fully grasp. Understanding how humans behave and interact with modern systems such as social media and online markets is essential for any effective business decision or successful public policy.  

During my Ph.D., I have been working on a range of empirical social and economic problems. The interdisciplinary nature of my research is a manifestation of my diverse training and interest in important and intriguing problems. My research combines economic and behavioral insights with advanced computational methods in causal inference and machine learning to tackle important managerial problems or answer questions of general interest in the social sciences. Unraveling causal relationships between factors is essential for any managerial intervention or policy. To this end, I use various forms of online/field/natural experimental designs to discover these causal links.
