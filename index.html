I am also pursuing a Ph.D. in *Statistics* at the 
<a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://stat.mit.edu/academics/idps/">Interdisciplinary Program for Statistics</a>, 
and affiliated with the 
 <a style="font-weight:bold" href="lids.mit.edu">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</a>.
<br>
I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Physics at the 
  <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://en.sharif.edu">Sharif University of Technology</a>. 


<p>
Considered broadly, I am a Computational Social Scientist. 
I study human behavior, how it interacts with information systems, and how it is shaped by different social and economic settings. 
I work on a range of empirical social and economic problems. The interdisciplinary nature of my research is a manifestation of my diverse training and interest in meaningful and intriguing problems.
