I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://css.seas.upenn.edu/">Computational Social Science Lab</a> at the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, and a Knight Fellow at the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://www.mediademocracy.org/">Center for Media, Technology, and Democracy</a>.

<br><br>

I obtained my Ph.D. in the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/">Social and Engineering Systems program</a> at the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://idss.mit.edu">MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society</a>, and in <span class="bolded">Statistics</span> through the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://stat.mit.edu/academics/idps/">Interdisciplinary Program in Statistics</a>. I was also affiliated with the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://lids.mit.edu">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</a>.

<br><br>

I received my Bachelor’s degree with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Physics from the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://en.sharif.edu">Sharif University of Technology</a>.

<p>
My research lies at the intersection of social science, data science, and public policy. I study information ecosystems—particularly media bias and misinformation—and how they shape public opinion and societal outcomes. I use computational and experimental methods to examine how narratives are constructed and disseminated in the digital age.
