I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Social and Engineering Systems program](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/) at the MIT [Institute for Data Systems and Society (IDSS)](https://idss.mit.edu), 
and also pursuing a Ph.D. in Statistics at the [Interdisciplinary Program for Statistics](https://stat.mit.edu/academics/idps/).
I am also affiliated with the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu) at MIT. 
I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Physics at the Sharif University of Technology, Iran. 


Considered broadly, I am a Computational Social Scientist. 
I study human behavior, how it interacts with information systems, and how it is shaped by different social and economic settings. 
I work on a range of empirical social and economic problems. The interdisciplinary nature of my research is a manifestation of my diverse training and interest in meaningful and intriguing problems.


My research combines economic and behavioral insights with advanced computational methods in causal inference and machine learning to tackle important managerial problems or answer questions of general interest in the social sciences.
To this end, I use various forms of online/field/natural experimental designs for valid causal identification.
