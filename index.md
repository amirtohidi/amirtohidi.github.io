I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [*Social and Engineering Systems*](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/) program at the [**MIT Institute for Data Systems and Society**](https://idss.mit.edu).
I am also pursuing a Ph.D. in *Statistics* at the [**Interdisciplinary Program for Statistics**](https://stat.mit.edu/academics/idps/), and affiliated with the [**Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems**](https://lids.mit.edu). 
I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree with a double major in *Electrical Engineering* and *Physics* at the [**Sharif University of Technology**](https://en.sharif.edu). 

Considered broadly, I am a Computational Social Scientist. 
I study human behavior, how it interacts with information systems, and how it is shaped by different social and economic settings. 
I work on a range of empirical social and economic problems. The interdisciplinary nature of my research is a manifestation of my diverse training and interest in meaningful and intriguing problems.
