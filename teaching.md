## Teaching Philosophy

I am professionally and personally indebted to the fantastic teachers who have contributed to my growth along the way. Consequently, I know that teachers can have a crucial influence on the future minds of our society. There are intellectual skills I value highly and would be adamant to impart to my students. Foremost is the ability to question assumptions and to question questions. Another essential ability is not to get confused by the complexities of an argument, a scientific theory, or an ideology. Rather, to simplify them, but not oversimplify them, to pinpoint their root assumptions. Pedagogically, I have a case-based problem-solving approach; I usually rely on practical examples to convey insights. I expect myself and my students to be able to think independently and systematically, aware of what our approaches and methods can and cannot do.
